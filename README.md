Hi,

I accidentally created this fork but shall use it for informative puposes if ok with everyone.
I was trying to find firmware for the Wanhao i3 mini with thermal runaway protection as I tested mine (by disconnecting the hotend terminals / set to heat to 210C method) and did not get the usual errors like "heating failed" or "Thermal Runaway..Printer Halted" although it seems to be enabled in the Configurations.h file in garychen's page.

I think I did find that firmware as the "heating failed" error came up (after a few seconds) on the firmware on the following page.
https://www.wanhao3dprinter.com/FAQ/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=91 and choose the i3mini-wanhao-130X160X130.hex file in step 4.

Hope that helps someone.

Cheers,
